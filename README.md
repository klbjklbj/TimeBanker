# TimeBanker

This app allows users of a community to register and update their accounts for a time bank that can exchange time hours of work as a virtual currency.

### Overview

![image1](./public/images/Timebanker.png)

The purpose of this project is to present members of a neighborhood or community with a platform, a time bank, that can strengthen their bonds among each other by engaging in activities or public services that can benefit others. The giver of services will receive credit from receivers. Since people live in the same neighborhood assume to have the same class, their time equivalence can also be assumed. One hour of service is tantamount to one credit, and the exchange of credit is followed by the completion of tasks demanded by receivers.

## How it Works

On the Home Page users can register (using the Register modal) and once they're registered, they can log into use TimeBanker. When logged in users can update their accounts by hitting the account update button.

## Room for Improvements

Error Messaging to Users - Currently both the registration and login pages refresh if there are any errors upon submission without providing any notification to the user. This project will benefit greatly once flash messaging is incorporated to let users know what they need to change.
